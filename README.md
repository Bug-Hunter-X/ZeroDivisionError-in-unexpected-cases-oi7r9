This repository contains a Python code example that showcases a ZeroDivisionError exception which might occur in a not so obvious way. The bug.py file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.py provides the corrected version. The error is particularly tricky because it only occurs under specific conditions, making it easy to overlook during initial development or testing. This example highlights the importance of thorough testing and defensive programming practices to avoid unexpected exceptions.
